_UNDER DEVELOPMENT! It is unstable, not use it!_

**mailgo**, from version `0.9.4` is fully compatible with TypeScript.

In file `mailgo.d.ts` are defined all the types of the library.

##Â Types

All the mailgo types are defined in `mailgo.d.ts`, already referenced in `types` attribute, so you can use them directly from `mailgo`, no `@types/mailgo` is necessary at the moment.

The latest version of the types is here: https://github.com/manzinello/mailgo/blob/master/mailgo.d.ts
