title: i18n in mailgo
---

**Mailgo** from `0.9.0` supports i18n.

The default behaviour of mailgo is to keep the `LANG` from the `<html>` element of the page.

Mailgo works **also** with `lang` that only **starts** with a language code, for example in case of

```html
<html lang="it-IT">
  ...
</html>
```

the `italian` language will be correctly displayed in mailgo modal.

However, you can also add some customization options of this behaviour. See [Configuration / Customization](/docs/customization).

## Available translations (and corrispondent language codes)

The available translation available in the latest version of mailgo are:

- English (`en`)
- Italian (`it`)
- Spanish (`es`)
- German (`de`)
- French (`fr`)
- Portuguese (`pt`)
- Dutch (`nl`)
- Russian (`ru`)
- Swedish (`sv`)
- Norwegian (`no`)
- Danish (`dk`)
