**Mailgo** also supports cc, bcc, subject and body in less-spam installation using the parameters:

- `data-cc-address` and `data-cc-domain` to recreate cc: `data-cc-address@data-cc-domain`;
- `data-bcc-address` and `data-bcc-domain` to recreate bcc: `data-bcc-address@data-bcc-domain`;
- `data-subject` for the subject of the email;
- `data-body` for the body of the email.

For the default installation you can use the classic `mailto` parameters and they will appear in the modal.
